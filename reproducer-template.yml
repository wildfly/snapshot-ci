# Reproducer Template Workflow Yaml File
#
#
# To use it to reproduce a failure:
#   * Make adjustments as indicated in the comments. These are:
#     - (Optional) Set up checkout and build of dependencies, making sure that checkout's 'path'
#       and run's 'working-dir' match
#     - Adjust the repository and ref of the 'Clone Main Component' step
#     - Choose the Java version in the 'Install Java' step
#     - If you needed some dependencies built, specify those as -Dversion property overrides
#       in the 'Build Main Component' step
#     - Adjust and uncomment the 'Run Tests' step. If you needed some dependencies built,
#       specify those as -Dversion property overrides
#   * copy it to the .github/workflows folder
#
# It will get run every time you update this and push. To populate the Maven cache to
# save time when rerunning (this only happens on a successful build) make sure to run
# it first without enabling the 'Run Tests' step. The step is commented out in this
# template to help you remember to do this.
#
# If you need SSH access, you can uncomment the 'Setup Tmate Session' to get access
# to a built server. It isn't perfect, but should work eventually. See
# https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate for more details of how to use it.
